Three of the four elements of the marketing mix (the four Ps) are central to this purpose: the <i>product</i> being offered to customers,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" id="ftnref1" href="ch05.xhtml#ftn1">a</a></sup><!-- ORIGINAL FOOTNOTE <sup><a epub:type="noteref" id="ftnref1" href="#ftn1">a</a></sup> --> <i>promotion</i> (how the firm communicates to potential customers about that product), and <i>place</i> (how and where the firm makes that product available to customers).</p><p class="indent1">The job of the fourth P, <i>price</i>&#x2014;the topic of this reading&#x2014;is to specify how the value that has been created can be divided appropriately between the customer (providing her an incentive to buy the product) and the organization (covering the costs associated with the value-creation effort and providing funds for profit and reinvestment in the organization). For more information on the interplay of the four Ps, see <i>Core Reading: Framework for Marketing Strategy Formation</i> (HBP No. 8153).</p><p class="indent">Pricing&#x2019;s critical nature is readily seen by the dramatic impact its effective management can have on the bottom line. Pricing researchers have noted that &#x201C;[t]he fastest and most effective way for a company to realize its maximum profit is to get its pricing right. The right price can boost profit faster than increasing volume will. . . .&#x201D;<sup><a epub:type="noteref" id="chn1" href="ch05.xhtml#fnt1">1</a></sup> This assessment was supported by an analysis of over 2,400 firms, which found that a 1% improvement in price realization (i.e., a 1% increase in the average price received with no change in sales volume) led to an average improvement in operating profit of 11.1%, while a 1% improvement in sales volume (with no change in average price) led to an average increase in profitability of only 3.3%. In 2013, for instance, a 1% improvement in price realization would have increased the profitability of DuPont by 7.4%, of Nike by 10.2%, of Boeing by 18.9%, and of Walmart by over 27%.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" id="chn2" href="ch05.xhtml#fnt2">2</a></sup></p><p class="indent">Researchers have long favored using a value perspective in pricing, or simply value pricing, which means basing the price of a product on its value to its chosen customers. For example, in the 1980s, Elliot Ross provided a diagnostic test for shrewd pricing, with one key question in that test being, &#x201C;Do you know the economic value of your product to your customers?&#x201D; He further noted that effective pricers regularly asked, &#x201C;Is the price accurately keyed to the value of the customer?&#x201D;<sup><a epub:type="noteref" id="chn3" href="ch05.xhtml#fnt3">3</a></sup> A decade later, Dolan and Simon set out a pricing IQ test to assist organizations in becoming power pricers. Such an organization, they wrote, &#x201C;rigorously assesses the value of its products and services, sees how this value varies across customers, and understands the drivers of value variation.&#x201D; The power pricer uses that understanding of customer value to focus the pricing process.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" id="chn4" href="ch05.xhtml#fnt4">4</a></sup></p><p class="indent">Value pricing hinges on two key elements. The first is a <i>value orientation</i>&#x2014;a focus on the economic value created by an organization&#x2019;s product for a given customer. The second is a set of <i>processes</i> to capture a portion of that value for the firm. Simon-Kucher &amp; Partners, a leading pricing consulting firm, regularly surveys executives on their perceptions of how well their companies do in capturing a fair share of the value they create for customers. <b><a href="#ex1">Exhibit 1</a></b> shows replies by managers, sorted by industry, suggesting the depth of the challenge most organizations face.</p></div><div class="page">    <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page3" title="4"></span><p id="ex1" class="exhibit"><span class="g-bold">EXHIBIT 1&#x00A0;</span> <span class="g-book">Perceptions of How Much Value Companies Capture</span></p><figure><img src="../images/8203_Ex1.png" alt="" /></figure><p class="source">Source: Reprinted from Harvard Business School, &#x201C;Outotec (A), Project Capture,&#x201D; HBS No. 514-064 by Robert J.

Nagle, Hogan, and Zale report the results of a research program showing &#x201C;companies that adopted a value-based pricing strategy <i>and</i> built the organizational capabilities to implement the strategy earned 24% higher profits than industry peers.&#x201D;<sup><a epub:type="noteref" id="chn6" href="ch05.xhtml#fnt6">6</a></sup></p><p class="indent">Despite the documented benefits of a value-based approach, <b><i><a class="keyterm-inline" epub:type="noteref" href="ch03.xhtml#kt4">cost-oriented pricing</a></i></b> continues to dominate the marketplace. This approach typically takes the form of cost-plus pricing, an approach in which an organization applies a predetermined markup to its cost to make or obtain the product. A manufacturer, for instance, might tally all the variable costs associated with the production of a good and simply add a markup of 25%. Why is cost-plus pricing so popular? First, the costs of production are relatively easy to estimate or measure. Indeed, in one survey, more than 80% of managers reported being well informed when it came to their organization&#x2019;s variable costs.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" id="chn7" href="ch05.xhtml#fnt7">7</a></sup> Second, cost-plus pricing is easy to justify to various stakeholders, with customers generally willing to pay a reasonable markup and investors accepting of a healthy margin. Third, for many organizations, it simplifies an otherwise complex pricing process. For example, consider a plumbing parts supplier that stocks thousands of unique parts. Under a cost-plus rule, adding a percentage to the known acquisition cost of each item completes the pricing job. However, these benefits of cost-plus pricing limit organizations&#x2019; ability to capture the full price customers might be willing to pay, which can be devastating to the company&#x2019;s bottom line.</p></div>    <div class="page">        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page4" title="5"></span>    <p class="indent">In the Essential Reading that follows, we present the value-based approach to pricing, the specific tools for implementing it, and some of the research methods that have benefited organizations. Our perspective is that of a firm setting the price for a differentiated product. We begin by introducing the basic value-pricing model and presenting the value-pricing thermometer to bring together the needed elements in this approach to pricing. We initially assume that the task is to set a single price across all of the firm&#x2019;s consumer segments.</p><p class="indent">In Section 2.2, we relax that assumption and introduce a concept known as price customization&#x2014;the potential to set different prices to different consumer segments based on their different valuations of the product being sold. Next, we address how best to set a price within the feasible range&#x2014;that is, the price range bounded by the customer&#x2019;s perceived value of a product and the organization&#x2019;s costs of goods sold&#x2014;and introduce two key areas of analysis. First, in Section 2.3, we consider the customers&#x2019; side of the equation, assessing their sensitivity to price and presenting a framework to help measure that sensitivity. Second, in Section 2.4, we consider the organization&#x2019;s side of the equation, judging the economic impact of various price- and sales-volume scenarios for the organization. Two particularly useful tools in this regard are <b><i><a class="keyterm-inline" epub:type="noteref" href="ch03.xhtml#kt1">breakeven analysis</a></i></b> and <b><i><a class="keyterm-inline" epub:type="noteref" href="ch03.xhtml#kt8">marginal math</a></i></b>.</p></div><!-- ORIGINAL FOOTNOTE<div class="page"><hr class="top"/><p class="hang"><a href="#ftnref1">a</a> <span id="ftn1" epub:type="footnote">Throughout this reading, the term <i>product</i> will refer both to physical goods and to services.</span></p></div>--></section></body></html>
